# new-project-navigation-modal

You've just created a new project. Maybe it's for a file to be moved into, or maybe it's just because you like projects. 
But the question is: do you want to go to that new project right now, or do you want to stay where you are?
This modal asks that question of your user.

## Parameters
### Node
A node object (or at least an object with a links.html in it) for navigating to.

### closeModal
An action to do whatever you need to close the modal when the user decides to stay here.

### title
A string of the call to action for creating a new project.
