# Written Style

## Clear language
Where long form text is used it is best to use descriptive language.

Include a period at the end of all full sentences in body text (including instructional and warning text). Headings should not include puncuation.

### Good examples
"Please follow the link to view this file."
"The project you selected is not available at this time."
"You have entered an incorrect name, please try again."
### Bad examples
"That's not right. Try again!"//Too colloquial:
"Go here." // Too curt
"Error: undefined" // Not human enough
"Yay, your form is submitted, awesome!"// Unnecessarily emotional

**Short form text** is supposed to be much more direct and refer to as specifically as possible the action of the item, for instance in buttons, labels.

### Good examples
"Open" "Delete Multiple" "Keep Both"
### Bad examples
"Open this file" // No need to define what element the action is on
"Delete everything" // Too general
"Name:"// Not descriptive enough, full name, first name?
"Cancel, Dismiss, Close" // Should use uniform name for same action

**Don't use jargon** that our users will be unfamiliar with. Language that is used around the office is not necessarily the language that is most descriptive to our users. Use words and phrases that they will be most familiar with, in the context of the OSF.

### Words to avoid
Node
Child/parent
Pointers

## Capitalization
The OSF website uses two main capitalization styles.

### Title case
The first word is always capitalized. All other words are capitalized except articles and short conjunctions and prepositions (fewer than 5 letters).

#### When to use title case
- All text in the top navigation bar (including dropdown text)
- Top level page titles (usually the heading with a h1 tag)

### Sentence case
The first word is always capitalized. All other words are lowercase unless they are proper nouns or quoted titles.

#### When to use sentence case
- Panel headings
- Modal titles
- Button text
- Form labels
- Input text
- Links
- All other elements

*When in doubt, use sentence case.*

**Note**: No element's text on the OSF should be completely lowercase. The first word in any element should always be capitalized.
