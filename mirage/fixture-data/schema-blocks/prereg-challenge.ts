The Preregistration Challenge stimulates experience with preregistration of analysis plans for hypothesis testing, and transparency about the distinction between confirmatory and exploratory analysis. Research plans using existing data present unique challenges for hypothesis testing because observation of data can influence subsequent analysis plans of the same data. This can produce a gray area between confirmatory and exploratory analysis. Research plans using existing data may not be eligible for the Challenge.
